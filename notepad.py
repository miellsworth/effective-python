# Chapter 1 - Pythonic Thinking
"""
An introduction to the adjective "Pythonic" and how it is used to described code
that follows a coding style that prefers to be explicit, simple over complex and
readable.
"""

## Item 1: Know which version of python you're using
# At the command line
"""
python --version
or check for installed versions using
py --list-paths
or pick the specific version you would like to use using
py -X.Y
"""

# At runtime
import sys
print(sys.version_info)
print(sys.version)

## Item 2: Follow the PEP 8 style guide
"""
Whitespace: 
- Perhaps the biggest surprise here is spaces instead of tabs
but it looks like vscode already converts tabs to 4 spaces
- No other surprises: pylint should handle a lot of these rules

Naming:
- Functions, variables and attributes: lowercase_underscore
- Protected instance attributes: _leading_underscore
- Private instance attributes: __double_leading_underscore
- Classes: CapitalizeWord
- Module-level constants: ALL_CAPS
- Instance methods: use self
- Class methods: use cls

Expressions and statements:
- Use inline negation (if a is not b) instead of negation of positive
expressions (if not a is b)
- Don't check for empty containers comparing to length zero (if len(somelist) == 0).
Use if not somelist and assume empty values will implicitly evaluate to False
- Similar rule for non-empty containers (if somelist)
- Avoid single line if statements, for and while loops and except compound statements
- If an expression doesn't fit on one line, surround it with parentheses and add
line breaks and indentation (instead of using \ line continuation)

Imports:
- Always include at the top of the file
- Imports should be in sections
  - standard library modules
  - third-party library modules
  - your own modules
"""

## Item 3: Know the Differences Between bytes and str
"""
Likely not the most relevant part of the chapter for me but it's interesting nonetheless!

Sequences of character data can be represented via two different types: bytes and str
- bytes: unsigned 8-bit values (binary data)
- str: Unicode code points (a unique number) that represent textual characters from human languages

Ensure you know which type you're working with as the types do not work together.
- Use helper functions to ensure you're using the type you're expecting

Reading and writing binary data requires binary mode
- 'rb' or 'wb' specified in open()

Be mindful of the text encoding you're using when reading and writing Unicode data
"""

## Item 4: Prefer Interpolated F-Strings Over C-style Format Strings and str.format
"""
Not a section of huge importance other than to remember to use F-strings

C-style format strings use the % operator and introduces a variety of problems
- code readibility
- verbosity

str.format and format solve a few of the issues but are not perfect and repeat the same mistakes

Interpolated format strings solve these issues
- Allows reference to all names in the current Python scope as part of a formatting expression
- More succinct
- Allow for directly embedded Python expressions within the format specifiers
"""
key = 'my_var'
value = 1.234

formatted = f'{key} = {value}'
print(formatted)
"""
The following represents all the different ways to format strings, showing the benefit of f strings
"""

f_string = f'{key:<10} = {value:.2f}'
c_tuple  = '%-10s = %.2f' % (key, value)
str_args = '{:<10} = {:.2f}'.format(key, value)
str_kw   = '{key:<10} = {value:.2f}'.format(key=key,
                                            value=value)
c_dict   = '%(key)-10s = %(value).2f' % {'key': key,
                                         'value': value}

assert c_tuple == c_dict == f_string
assert str_args == str_kw == f_string
